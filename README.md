# AI-MazeMaster

Developed by r0m454rc4

## Description
Welcome to AI-MazeMaster, a React Native app where you can draw or open previously created mazes for an AI agent to solve using Q-Learning, a reinforcement learning algorithm. This README will guide you through the functionalities of the app and how to use them effectively.

## Getting Started

To get started with AI-MazeMaster, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine: `git clone git@github.com:r0m454rc4/AI-MazeMaster.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd AI-MazeMaster`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run the app: `npm start`
5. Follow the instructions in the terminal to launch the app on your desired platform (iOS, Android, or web).

## Features

### Drawing or Opening Mazes

- **Drawing Mazes:** You can draw your own mazes using the drawing tool provided in the app. Simply use your finger or mouse to draw the maze layout on the screen.

- **Opening Mazes:** Alternatively, you can open previously created maze files. The app supports plain txt files representing maze configurations.

### AI Agent Training

- **Training:** AI-MazeMaster utilizes Q-Learning, a reinforcement learning algorithm, to train an AI agent to navigate mazes efficiently. The training process occurs in the backend, powered by machine learning.

### Maze Solving

- **Solving:** Once the AI agent is trained, you can deploy it to solve mazes drawn or opened in the app. The AI agent will employ its learned policy to find the optimal path through the maze.

### Visualization

- **Visualization Tools:** AI-MazeMaster provides visualization tools to display the maze, the agent's current position, and its path through the maze. This helps users understand the agent's behavior and the strategies it employs to solve mazes.
