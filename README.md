# MazeMaster_A-Star-Solver

Developed by r0m454rc4

## Description
Welcome to MazeMaster_A-Star-Solver, a React Native app where you can draw or open previously created mazes for an A* algorithm to solve. This README will guide you through the functionalities of the app and how to use them effectively.


## Getting Started
To get started with MazeMaster_A-Star-Solver, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine: `git clone git@github.com:r0m454rc4/MazeMaster_A-Star-Solver.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd MazeMaster_A-Star-Solver`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run the app: `npm start`
5. Follow the instructions in the terminal to launch the app on your desired platform (iOS or Android).

## Features

### Drawing or Opening Mazes

- **Drawing Mazes:** Use the drawing tool provided in the app to create your own mazes. Simply use your finger or mouse to draw the maze layout on the screen. The order of drawing is important; the maze must be drawn using the elements from left to right.

- **Opening Mazes:** Alternatively, you can open previously created maze files. The app supports plain text files representing maze configurations.

### A* Algorithm

- **Solving:** Once the maze is opened, the A* algorithm will be called to solve the maze. The algorithm will find the optimal path through the maze from start to goal.

### Visualization

- **Visualization Tools:** MazeMaster_A-Star-Solver provides tools to visualize the maze, the decisions made by the A* algorithm, and its path through the maze. This helps users understand the algorithm's behavior and the strategies it employs to solve mazes.
